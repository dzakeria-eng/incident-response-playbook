# Incident Response Playbook (NIST 800-61)

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of incident response by building a full NIST 800-61–aligned playbook with two complete real-world scenarios: phishing compromise and ransomware infection. The goal of this project is to simulate how a cybersecurity analyst analyzes alerts, contains threats, collects evidence, and restores operations while following industry-standard procedures.
